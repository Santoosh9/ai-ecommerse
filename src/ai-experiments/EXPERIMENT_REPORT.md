# E-commerce Recommendation System Experiment Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of three recommendation algorithms implemented for an e-commerce platform. The experiment evaluates **Popularity-based**, **Content-based**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors Collaborative Filtering** algorithms using a real-world e-commerce dataset containing 397,924 interactions from 4,339 users across 3,665 products.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Records**: 541,910 (raw data)
- **Cleaned Records**: 397,924 (73.4% retention rate)
- **Unique Users**: 4,339
- **Unique Items**: 3,665
- **Data Quality**: Removed records with missing CustomerID, Description, StockCode, or invalid quantities

## Code Architecture & Implementation

### 1. Project Configuration (`package.json`)

**Purpose**: Project manifest defining dependencies and execution scripts.

**Key Components**:
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `papaparse`: CSV data parsing
  - `fs-extra`: Enhanced file system operations
  - `asciichart`: Terminal-based chart generation
  - `chalk`: Colored console output for professional logging

- **Scripts**:
  - `npm start`: Execute complete experiment pipeline
  - `npm run preprocess`: Run data preprocessing only
  - `npm run experiment`: Run recommendation algorithms and evaluation
  - `npm run full`: Execute preprocessing followed by experiment

**Output**: No direct output, but enables the entire experiment workflow.

### 2. Data Preprocessing (`preprocess.js`)

**Purpose**: Transform raw e-commerce data into structured format suitable for recommendation algorithms.

**Key Functions**:
```javascript
preprocessDataset(inputPath, outputPath)
```

**Processing Steps**:
1. **Data Loading**: Reads `data.csv` using Papa Parse with header support
2. **Data Cleaning**: Filters out records with missing CustomerID, Description, StockCode, or zero quantities
3. **Structure Building**: Creates two data structures:
   - `interactions[]`: Array of individual user-item interactions
   - `userItemMatrix{}`: User-item matrix with purchase quantities
4. **Statistics Calculation**: Computes dataset statistics (users, items, interactions)
5. **Data Persistence**: Saves processed data as `dataset/preprocessed.json`

**Output Files**:
- `dataset/preprocessed.json` (83MB): Structured data for recommendation algorithms

**Console Output**:
```
âš¡ Preprocessing dataset...
ðŸ“Š Total records: 541910
ðŸ§¹ Cleaned records: 397924
âœ… Preprocessed data saved: dataset/preprocessed.json
ðŸ‘¤ Users: 4339
ðŸ“¦ Items: 3665
ðŸ”„ Interactions: 397924
```

### 3. Recommendation Algorithms (`recommend.js`)

**Purpose**: Implements three distinct recommendation algorithms with optimized performance.

#### 3.1 Popularity-Based Recommender
```javascript
popularityRec(interactions, userItemMatrix, N = 10)
```

**Algorithm**: Recommends globally most popular items based on purchase frequency.

**Implementation**:
- Counts total purchase quantity for each item across all users
- Sorts items by frequency in descending order
- Returns top N most popular items

**Advantages**: Simple, fast, good baseline performance
**Disadvantages**: No personalization, cold-start problem

#### 3.2 Content-Based Recommender
```javascript
contentRec(userItemMatrix, interactions, N = 10)
```

**Algorithm**: Recommends items similar to user's purchase history.

**Implementation**:
- Pre-calculates item popularity frequencies
- For each user, filters out already purchased items
- Recommends most popular items not yet purchased by user

**Optimization**: Simplified implementation for speed without complex TF-IDF calculations

**Advantages**: Personalization, handles cold-start for items
**Disadvantages**: Limited content analysis in current implementation

#### 3.3 K-Nearest Neighbors Collaborative Filtering
```javascript
knnRec(userItemMatrix, N = 10, k = 3)
```

**Algorithm**: Recommends items based on similar users' preferences.

**Implementation**:
- Calculates cosine similarity between users based on purchase patterns
- Finds k nearest neighbors for each user
- Aggregates items from neighbors (excluding user's own purchases)
- Scores items by neighbor similarity and purchase quantity

**Optimizations**:
- Processes only first 100 users for speed
- Limits neighbor calculation to 50 users per target user
- Uses popularity fallback for remaining users

**Advantages**: Personalization, discovers hidden patterns
**Disadvantages**: Computationally expensive, sparsity issues

#### 3.4 Main Recommendation Generator
```javascript
generateAllRecommendations(userItemMatrix, interactions, testUsers, N = 10)
```

**Purpose**: Orchestrates recommendation generation for all algorithms.

**Output**: Object containing recommendations for all three algorithms for all test users.

### 4. Evaluation Metrics (`metrics.js`)

**Purpose**: Implements standard recommendation system evaluation metrics.

#### 4.1 Core Metrics

**Precision@K**:
```javascript
precisionAtK(recommended, actual, k)
```
- Measures proportion of recommended items that are relevant
- Formula: `hits / k` where hits = relevant items in top K

**Recall@K**:
```javascript
recallAtK(recommended, actual, k)
```
- Measures proportion of relevant items successfully recommended
- Formula: `hits / total_relevant_items`

**nDCG@K**:
```javascript
ndcgAtK(recommended, actual, k)
```
- Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
- Considers position of relevant items in recommendation list
- Accounts for ranking quality

#### 4.2 System Metrics

**Coverage**:
```javascript
coverage(allRecommendations, totalItems)
```
- Percentage of unique items recommended across all users
- Measures recommendation diversity

**Latency**:
```javascript
latency(start, end)
```
- Time taken for recommendation generation (milliseconds)
- Performance measurement

#### 4.3 Aggregation Functions

**User Metrics**:
```javascript
calculateUserMetrics(recommended, actual, k = 10)
```
- Calculates precision, recall, nDCG for individual user

**Average Metrics**:
```javascript
calculateAverageMetrics(allRecommendations, testData, k = 10)
```
- Aggregates metrics across all test users

### 5. Visualization (`charts.js`)

**Purpose**: Generates visual representations of experimental results.

#### 5.1 ASCII Charts (Terminal Display)
```javascript
generateAsciiCharts(metrics)
```

**Features**:
- **Precision & Recall Comparison**: Bar charts using ASCII characters
- **nDCG Line Chart**: Line plot showing ranking quality
- **Coverage Comparison**: Percentage bars for recommendation diversity

**Output**: Real-time terminal visualization during experiment execution

#### 5.2 PNG Charts (Disabled)
```javascript
generatePngCharts(metrics)
```

**Note**: PNG chart generation is currently disabled to avoid external dependencies.

### 6. Experiment Orchestration (`run_experiment.js`)

**Purpose**: Main experiment pipeline that coordinates all components.

#### 6.1 Experiment Workflow

**Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
- Calls `preprocessDataset()` to clean and structure data
- Loads preprocessed data into memory

**Step 2: Train/Test Split**
- Splits users into 80% training, 20% testing
- Creates test data (last 20% of interactions per user)
- Ensures each test user has at least one item for evaluation

**Step 3: Recommendation Generation**
- Calls `generateAllRecommendations()` for all three algorithms
- Measures total generation time
- Processes 868 test users

**Step 4: Metric Calculation**
- Calculates precision@10, recall@10, nDCG@10 for each algorithm
- Computes coverage and latency metrics
- Aggregates results across all test users

**Step 5: Results Persistence**
- Saves `metrics.json` with all calculated metrics
- Generates `table1.csv` (Precision/Recall/nDCG)
- Generates `table2.csv` (Coverage/Latency)

**Step 6: Visualization**
- Calls `generateAsciiCharts()` for terminal display
- Attempts PNG chart generation (disabled)

**Step 7: Results Summary**
- Displays final results table
- Identifies best performing algorithms
- Lists output files
